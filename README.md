# Learning to Rank - Point-wise Approach
Developer: Himanshu Aggarwal

Please find the **Report** at **'/reports/Assignment Report.pdf'**. It contains all ther deailts. 

Please find the implementation code as a **notebook** at **‘/notebooks/ranking_model.ipynb’**, or as **HTML doc** at **‘/reports/ranking_model.html’**.


### Folder Structure
* /data : contains datasets
* /notebooks : contains ipynb notebooks for EDA and Modelling 
* /reports : contains assignment reposts and EDA document
* /src : contains structured code for ranking model
* README.md : project details
* requirements.txt : packages required to run the project

### Description
You are given an anonymized dataset containing user sessions. Your task is to train a ranking model which yields the best ordering of the content (more relevant venues should appear at the top more frequently).

Tasks:
- Create a non-ML baseline model (e. g. simple rule like “sort by the value of some column”)
- Choose a metric that reflects ranking quality and justify your choice
- Train ML ranking model that outperforms the baseline ranker in terms of chosen metric (assume that this model will be used to score content in realtime, so choose the model
and frameworks accordingly)
  

### Note
- Data can't be made public
- You may use this code for your experimentation as you like
